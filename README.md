# MemoryGeneralization-Thesis

Memory generalization is a cognitive process in which the brain applies information learned from a particular experience to a new, similar situation. The current study examines memory generalization and aims to answer two questions surrounding it. The first question is whether there is a trade-off between remembering the specific details of a stimulus and generalizing the associations between learned stimuli to new situations. The second question explores the mnemonic structures that support generalization, asking how different types of memory representations (semantic vs. visual) facilitate generalization. In the study, participants encoded object pairs and were later tasked with an associative inference test, two representation tests, and a recognition memory test. The results revealed a positive correlation between generalization and detailed memory and indicated that semantic representations facilitate generalization more effectively than visual representations. Overall, this study advances the current understanding of memory generalization, shedding light on its underlying mechanisms and providing insights that could refine methods for improving learning and memory outcomes.
